A list of issues that I will solve later
---
- the filter for main and sideboard is done with ugly code.
	soln: Use the two way filter suggested on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11616636/how-to-do-two-way-filtering-in-angular-js
- nice formatting
	soln: use bootstrap stuff to make every look ince and fit nicely.
- the typeahead doesn't work well with angular.
	soln: use the angular typeahead library
- the visual side and hidden board aren't there yet.
	soln: create a filter for them and show them. side is minimized and hidden is minimized and only text, organized by colour. 
- code is disorganized
	soln: put things in their own files and organize the structure
- no tests
	soln: write runners to test everything.
